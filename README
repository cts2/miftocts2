This directory contains a series of tranformations that generate CTS2 output from HL7 MIF 2.1.6 input.

To work, this directory must be a sibling of the hl7owl directory, which contains transforms from MIF to OWL.
To create it:
> cd ..
> mkdir hl7owl
> cd hl7owl
> svn co http://gforge.hl7.org/svn/hl7owl/trunk .

There are 8 parameters in the transforms/VocabToCTS2.xslt:
    doCTS2CodeSystem
    doCTS2CodeSystemVersion
    doCTS2ConceptDomain
    doCTS2ConceptDomainBinding
    doCTS2Concept
    doCTS2Association
    doCTS2ValueSet
    doCTS2ValueSetDefinition
    
that control what output is generated.

There is a test directory (unitTest) that has a number of xspec tests.  Note that
there is a file called 'basedoc.xspec' that contains the name of the target transformation.
